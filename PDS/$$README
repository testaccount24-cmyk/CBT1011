SDSF Usermod
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhere between z/OS 2.2 and 2.4 SDSF DA command refused to work
without RMF.

After upgrade to z/OS V2R4, SDSF DA command received
msg ISF452E SDSFAUX communications failed,
return code 0x00000004, reason code 0x00750412
function "query DA". RMF required to process request.

I opened an IBM case and was told:

To request that DA use the MVS control blocks rather than RMF, and
prevent display of this message, the installation can use the
installation exit point of ISFUSER. For more information on the
installation exit routines, refer to Chapter 9,  Using Installation Exit
Routines," on page 389 of the SDSF v2.4 Operations and Customization
Guide.  Look to section "Initialization Exit Point", specifically, field
name UPRSFLAG.UPRNORMF.
