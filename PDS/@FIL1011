//***FILE1011 is from Dana Mitchell and contains an SDSF exit that  *   FILE1011
//*           tells SDSF to ignore RMF if it is not present.  This  *   FILE1011
//*           has presented a problem when converting from z/OS     *   FILE1011
//*           2.2 to z/OS 2.4.  See members $$NOTE01 and $$REAADME  *   FILE1011
//*           for more details.                                     *   FILE1011

//*           It seems that (lately) when you do a DA under SDSF,   *   FILE1011
//*           then SDSF will sometimes try to use RMF control       *   FILE1011
//*           blocks instead of MVS control blocks.  This causes    *   FILE1011
//*           a nasty message, and we want to get rid of it.        *   FILE1011

//*     Note from Sam Golob:  I have included a "pure assembly      *   FILE1011
